                    <p>This project was a good exercise on how to use the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag in HTML and
                        work with game logic. The aesthetics of this game were quite a big accomplishment because it was

                    <p>This project utilized local storage so that the activity log could track everything that you did
                        in the last period of time. From this project, I learned about local storage, creating a good
                        layout in HTML so that I could design things appropriately.</p>

                    <h3>Simple PHP PVE Game</h3>
                    <p>I was able to use PHP, database, and sessions to create a simple game where you could create a
                        character and any items that you wanted and then have a 1v1 battle. This was my first exposure
                        to databases, with their respective primary and foreign keys. It then query the database to read
                        and write the applicable information and then I used client-side JavaScript to compute the
                        differences in a attack, defense, armor, etc.</p>

                        characteristics about yourself, and then go on a story. It have a varying storyline based on
                        what you choose that references the options that you choose.</p>
